This project is completed as a submission for the Testing: Connect Four project in the Ruby Programming curriculum at [The Odin Project](http://theodinproject.com). A full description of the assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/testing-your-ruby-code).

The goal of this project was to utilize Test-Driven Development with Rspec to create Connect Four playable by two human players in the Command Line. All code was written by [Devin Mork](https://github.com/Demo318).

Requires [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) to install dependencies.

To execute the program: 1) Download the repository, 2) In the Command Line, navigate to the repository's home directory, 3) Enter ```bunndle install```, 4) Then ```ruby play_connect_four.rb```.

To run tests, simply enter ```rake```. If all test pass, test coverage report will be placed in `./coverage/index.html`.

Built using Ruby v.2.5
